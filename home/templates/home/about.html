                    The goal of SimulationScape is to give players helpful tools and insight into Old School Runescape,
                the game that we all love. The initial tools that I'm intending to create are tools that help satisfy
                curiosity; ever wanted to know the total loot you would get from 10,000 zulrah kills? Cox? A simulation
                that rolls on their loot tables as many times as you want is one such tool. Not only will it satisfy
                curiosity but it can be helpful in estimating certain loot that you will get from various bosses.

                    Hi! My name is Nate and I've been playing runescape for over 10 years. I began back in middle
                    school when my friends found the game on miniclip and we all spent countless hours exploring
                    and enjoying the MMO experience that was completely new to us. Fast forward some years and
                    old school was released, I had grown tired of the original runescape and jumped onto osrs
                    the first day it launched.
                    <br><br>
                    I spent my years in the original rs as a pker but began making the switch to a skiller around
                    the time of osrs being released. Initially in osrs my goal was to make a 'piety pure' and I
                    was the first person to have the 60 att 70 def piety build in old school runescape. I always
                    enjoyed runecrafting and it was how I made my money and I began doing other skills, I was one
                    of the first people in osrs to get 91 rc for the best money at the time, double nature runes.
                    I consistently held around rank 100-200 area in the overall highscores for the first 3 years
                    or so of osrs while working a job. With my best overall ranks being around rank 60. I was around
                    the 130th person to max total level in osrs. I held the record play time for achieving barrows gloves
                    for a period, taking just 28 hours 33 minutes from a brand new account to having completed
                    Recipe For Disaster.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the original runescape I've been making videos and really focusing on it more at the
                    beginning of osrs as I began to really compete for ranks and firsts, unlike I ever had in
                    the original runescape. My videos focused mostly on my progress through the game, guides,
                    pking, and game updates.
                    <br><br>
                    I went to university for computer science and that's where my focus is currently.
                    I don't have as much time to play anymore but I still
                    enjoy spreading the knowledge of the game that I gained over the years and thousands upon
                    thousands of hours of playing the game.
